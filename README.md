# SAT-Centre-Close-Checker
A simple python script that checks if your SAT / SAT Subject Centre is closed. 

# Why?

As my SAT and SAT Subject Tests are on September 26th and October 3rd respectively, there has been a lot of talk that my centre will be closed on these days. If so, I will need to be as quickly informed as possible, to make changes to my registration / call the collegeboard to change my test centre. This is why I'm writing a script that simplifies this process.
